# KIND-ID Security Audit Procedures

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the audit framework, methodology, and responsibilities for conducting **security audits** of KIND-ID.  
It ensures that KIND-ID’s systems, processes, and controls remain compliant with internal policies and global cybersecurity standards.  
It aligns with:  
- [Security and Threat Model](../docs/SECURITY_AND_THREAT_MODEL.md)  
- [Audit Logging Policy](../docs/AUDIT_LOGGING_POLICY.md)  
- [Governance Charter](../docs/GOVERNANCE_CHARTER.md)

---

## 2. Audit Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Verification** | Confirm that implemented security controls operate as designed. |
| **Detection** | Identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and process gaps. |
| **Accountability** | Verify compliance with governance and regulatory frameworks. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Drive remediation and preventive measures. |

---

## 3. Audit Frequency and Types

| Audit Type | Scope | Frequency | Responsible Party |
|-------------|--------|------------|--------------------|
| **Internal Security Audit** | Code, infrastructure, documentation | Quarterly | Security Officer |
| **External Independent Audit** | Penetration testing, compliance validation | Annually | Third-party auditor |
| **Spot Check Audit** | Random or triggered by incidents | As needed | Governance Board |
| **Post-Change Audit** | After major releases or cryptographic updates | Within 7 days | DevSecOps |

---

## 4. Audit Scope

Audits cover:
- Source repositories (`kindid/`, `server/`, `extension/`)  
- Infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker images, CI/CD pipeline)  
- Access control configurations  
- Audit logging and retention systems  
- Cryptographic implementations and key management  
- Compliance with the [Change Management Policy](../docs/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md)

Excluded: personal devices and unapproved forks.

## 5. Methodology

| Phase | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Planning** | Define scope, assign auditors, set timeline. |
| **Information Gathering** | Review architecture, configurations, dependencies. |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Automated scanning (`trivy`, `bandit`, `nikto`, `npm audit`). |
| **Manual Review** | Code walkthrough for cryptographic correctness and logic flaws. |
| **Penetration Testing** | Simulated attacks on API endpoints and authentication flow. |
| **Reporting** | Document findings, severity, and remediation plan. |
| **Follow-up** | Verify closure of identified issues. |

All tools and logs are version-locked and stored in `/audit/evidence/`.

---

## 6. Evidence Collection

- Audit trails exported from the production environment using read-only credentials.  
- Hashes of evidence files recorded in the audit chain for authenticity.  
- Screenshots, scan outputs, and log excerpts stored in encrypted archives.  
- Retention: minimum of 2 years per NIST and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.  

---

## 7. Risk Rating Criteria

| Severity | Description | Required Action |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Direct system compromise possible. | Patch within 24 hours. |
| **High** | Exploitable weakness with authentication bypass risk. | Fix within 72 hours. |
| **Medium** | Requires specific conditions or low probability. | Fix in next release. |
| **Low** | Minimal risk, informational finding. | Monitor and document. |

---

## 8. Reporting Structure

1. **Draft Report** – Created by audit lead, reviewed internally.  
2. **Final Report** – Signed by Security Officer and Governance Chair.  
3. **Remediation Plan** – Includes responsible party, deadline, and status.  
4. **Post-Audit Review** – Conducted after 30 days to ensure fixes applied.  

Reports stored under:
```

/docs/audits/YYYY-MM/

```

## 9. Audit Tools and References

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `trivy` | Container and dependency CVE scanning |
| `bandit` | Python static code analysis |
| `nikto` | Web vulnerability scanning |
| `nmap` | Network and port security |
| `gitleaks` | Secret scanning in repositories |
| `lynis` | System hardening audit |

Standards referenced:
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022  
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS v4.0)

---

## 10. Remediation and Follow-Up

| Stage | Responsibility | Verification |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Fix implementation | Developer or maintainer | Peer review |
| Validation test | Security Officer | Regression testing |
| Closure approval | Governance Board | Signed off in `/docs/audits/summary.md` |

All remediations must include updated threat modeling entries.

---

## 11. Confidentiality and Ethics

- Audit reports are confidential and stored in encrypted format.  
- Only authorized personnel can access raw findings.  
- Disclosure of vulnerabilities to external parties follows coordinated responsible disclosure protocol.  
- All auditors must sign the KIND-ID **Audit Confidentiality Agreement** before engagement.  

---

## 12. Continuous Improvement

- Aggregate recurring issues to track systemic weaknesses.  
- Use findings to update training and secure coding practices.  
- Review this procedure annually and after any major incident.
