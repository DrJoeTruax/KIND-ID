# KIND-ID Change Management Policy

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes formal change control procedures for all KIND-ID components — including SDK, Server, Extension, and Documentation.  
It ensures stability, traceability, and accountability throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.  
It complements:  
- [System Design Specification](../docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN_SPEC.md)  
- [Audit Logging Policy](../docs/AUDIT_LOGGING_POLICY.md)  
- [Governance Charter](../docs/GOVERNANCE_CHARTER.md)

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:
- Source code modifications  
- Configuration and infrastructure changes  
- Documentation updates affecting procedures or security  
- Third-party dependency updates  

Does not apply to:
- Internal developer notes  
- Cosmetic UI changes not affecting functionality  

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Transparency** | All changes are visible, reviewed, and auditable. |
| **Reversibility** | Any change can be rolled back safely. |
| **Minimal Disruption** | Production stability takes precedence. |
| **Evidence-Based Approval** | Every change must include justification and test proof. |
| **Separation of Duties** | No individual can develop, approve, and deploy the same change. |

---

## 4. Change Categories

| Category | Definition | Approval Level |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Standard** | Routine, low-risk, pre-approved (e.g., dependency patch). | Developer / Reviewer |
| **Normal** | Planned change with documented test plan. | Maintainer |
| **Emergency** | Urgent fix for security or outage. | Governance Lead |
| **Major** | Architectural, API, or cryptographic change. | Governance Board |

---

## 5. Change Lifecycle

1. **Request** – Submit a Change Request (CR) via GitHub issue template.  
2. **Impact Assessment** – Reviewer evaluates security, compatibility, and performance impact.  
3. **Approval** – Maintainer or board authorizes merge.  
4. **Testing** – Unit, integration, and regression tests run automatically.  
5. **Deployment** – Executed via CI/CD pipelines per [Deployment Manual](../docs/DEPLOYMENT_MANUAL.md).  
6. **Verification** – Post-deployment validation and log inspection.  
7. **Closure** – CR marked complete with references to commits and test results.

## 7. Testing and Validation Requirements

| Test Type           | Mandatory For                     | Tool              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Unit Tests          | All changes                       | `pytest`          |
| Integration Tests   | Server / API changes              | `pytest-docker`   |
| Security Scan       | Any dependency or crypto change   | `bandit`, `trivy` |
| Performance Test    | Server logic or DB schema changes | `locust`          |
| Documentation Check | Markdown or build changes         | `markdownlint`    |

All test artifacts retained for 12 months.

## 8. Rollback Strategy

| Scenario                     | Rollback Method                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Failure**      | Revert to previous Git tag                                 |
| **Database Migration Error** | Apply rollback script (`/migrations/rollback.sql`)         |
| **Extension Malfunction**    | Redeploy last stable build                                 |
| **Configuration Drift**      | Restore snapshot from Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) version |

Rollback operations logged in the audit trail.

## 9. Approval Matrix

| Role             | Authority                            | Required for      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Developer        | Submit change                        | Standard          |
| Maintainer       | Review & approve                     | Normal            |
| Security Officer | Approve crypto or dependency changes | Major / Emergency |
| Governance Board | Final authorization                  | Major             |

---

## 10. Documentation Update Protocol

All major or security-relevant changes require corresponding updates in:

* `/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
* `/docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN_SPEC.md`
* `/docs/SECURITY_AND_THREAT_MODEL.md`

Commits must include:

```
[docs-update] Reflect change in <filename>.md
```

---

## 11. Audit and Review

* Quarterly internal review of change records.
* Annual third-party audit for compliance validation.
* Randomized spot checks for unauthorized direct merges.

All audit findings stored in `/docs/audits/YYYY/`.

---

## 12. Emergency Procedure

When urgent action is required (e.g., CVE exploit):

1. Initiate emergency branch (`hotfix/<issue_id>`).
2. Run limited regression test suite.
3. Merge with two maintainer approvals.
4. Document action in `/docs/incidents/`.
5. Apply postmortem within 48 hours.

---

## 13. Continuous Improvement

Change process maturity is tracked via KPIs:

* Review time per CR
* Number of unplanned rollbacks
* Audit non-conformances

Results inform quarterly governance updates.
