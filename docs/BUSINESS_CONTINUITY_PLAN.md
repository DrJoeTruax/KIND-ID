# KIND-ID Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

The **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** ensures that KIND-ID operations can continue or be rapidly restored following any disruption, incident, or disaster.  
It aligns with the [Risk Register](../docs/RISK_REGISTER.md), [Monitoring and Maintenance Guide](../docs/MONITORING_AND_MAINTENANCE.md), and [Governance Charter](../docs/GOVERNANCE_CHARTER.md).

---

## 2. Objectives

| Objective | Target |
|------------|---------|
| **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** | ≤ 4 hours |
| **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** | ≤ 1 hour of data loss |
| **Critical Service Restoration** | ≤ 2 hours for authentication core |
| **Communication Response** | Immediate acknowledgment within 30 minutes |

---

## 3. Scope

This plan covers:
- KIND-ID servers, databases, and services  
- CI/CD infrastructure and documentation hosting  
- Extension distribution and update pipelines  
- Governance communications and user support systems  

---

## 4. Risk Scenarios and Response Strategies

| Scenario | Impact | Recovery Strategy |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Data Center Outage** | Service interruption | Failover to secondary cloud provider within 1 hour. |
| **Database Corruption** | Data integrity risk | Restore from verified backup; rebuild from audit log chain. |
| **Ransomware / Security Breach** | System compromise | Isolate, rebuild from clean image, revoke compromised keys. |
| **Loss of Maintainers** | Operational pause | Activate secondary maintainers listed in `/docs/contacts/`. |
| **Supply Chain Attack** | Dependency compromise | Validate package hashes, revert to last verified version. |

---

## 5. Business Impact Analysis

| Service | Criticality | Max Downtime | Recovery Method |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Authentication API** | Critical | 2 hours | Hot standby + autoscaling |
| **Audit Logging** | Critical | 4 hours | Immutable backup + delayed reindex |
| **Extension Updates** | High | 24 hours | Secondary CDN and mirror build |
| **Documentation Site** | Medium | 48 hours | Static rebuild from repository |
| **Internal CI/CD** | High | 12 hours | Restore runner images and workflow cache |

---

## 6. Communication Plan

| Role | Responsibility | Channel |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Incident Commander** | Leads recovery coordination | Email + Matrix `/kindid/ops` |
| **Technical Lead** | Implements fixes and system restoration | GitHub + Slack |
| **Governance Liaison** | Manages stakeholder communication | Email + press statement |
| **Compliance Officer** | Reports to regulators if required | Legal email chain |

All incidents are logged under `/docs/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

## 7. Backup and Recovery

- **Database Backups:** Hourly incremental, daily full, verified weekly.  
- **Audit Logs:** Replicated to S3 with cross-region redundancy.  
- **Configuration Snapshots:** Daily export of `/config` and secrets (encrypted).  
- **Verification:** Random recovery tests every quarter.  

Restoration verification checklist:
1. Database restored successfully.  
2. Audit hashes match original signatures.  
3. No missing entries in blockchain root index.  
4. Authentication pipeline functional.  

---

## 8. Alternate Operations Strategy

- **Cold Site:** Minimal environment replicating production config (manual activation).  
- **Hot Site:** Always-on backup server mirroring production (for authentication API).  
- **Cloud Agnosticism:** Kubernetes manifests enable redeployment to alternate provider within 2 hours.  
- **Local Continuity:** Offline installer packages ensure limited functionality during outages.  

---

## 9. Post-Incident Review

Within 72 hours of incident resolution:
1. Conduct debrief with technical and governance teams.  
2. Document root cause, timeline, and corrective actions.  
3. Update risk severity in [RISK_REGISTER.md](../docs/RISK_REGISTER.md).  
4. File summary under `/docs/postmortems/`.  

---

## 10. Plan Testing and Review

| Type | Frequency | Method |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Tabletop Exercise** | Quarterly | Simulated outage drill |
| **Failover Test** | Semiannual | Switch to standby infrastructure |
| **Full Recovery Test** | Annual | End-to-end restore verification |

BCP effectiveness measured by RTO/RPO compliance and incident review outcomes.

---

## 11. Plan Governance

- Maintained by the **KIND-ID Governance Board**.  
- Reviewed every 6 months or after significant system changes.  
- Updated BCP version recorded in `/docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
