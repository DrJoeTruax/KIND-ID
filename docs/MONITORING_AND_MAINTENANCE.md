# KIND-ID Monitoring and Maintenance Guide

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines post-deployment monitoring, maintenance, and operational assurance procedures for **KIND-ID**.  
It extends the [Deployment Manual](../docs/DEPLOYMENT_MANUAL.md) and enforces continuous reliability, performance, and security.

---

## 2. Operational Objectives

| Objective | Target Metric |
|------------|----------------|
| **Uptime** | â‰¥ 99.95% monthly |
| **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** | < 3 minutes |
| **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)** | < 30 minutes |
| **Average Request Latency** | < 150 ms |
| **Incident Response Time** | < 10 minutes |

---

## 3. Monitoring Stack

| Component | Tool | Function |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Server Metrics** | Prometheus | Collects CPU, RAM, I/O, and API response times. |
| **Visualization** | Grafana | Displays dashboards for metrics and alerts. |
| **Logs** | Loki | Aggregates application and access logs. |
| **Security Events** | Falco | Detects runtime anomalies. |
| **Health Checks** | UptimeRobot / Pingdom | External availability monitoring. |

---

## 4. Key Metrics to Track

| Category | Metric | Alert Threshold |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **API** | 5xx Error Rate | >1% for 5 minutes |
| **Database** | Query Latency | >100 ms average |
| **Server** | CPU Utilization | >85% sustained |
| **Memory** | RAM Usage | >90% |
| **Disk** | Free Space | <15% |
| **Network** | Packet Loss | >2% |
| **Authentication** | Failed Logins | >10/minute |
| **Extension Sync** | Timeout Rate | >5% |

---

## 5. Alerting

- **Primary Channels:** Email + PagerDuty  
- **Secondary:** Slack webhook integration (`/alerts/kindid`)  
- **Escalation Flow:**
  1. On-call engineer (Level 1)
  2. Security/DevOps team (Level 2)
  3. Governance board (Level 3, for major incidents)

All alerts must include:
- Timestamp  
- Component name  
- Metric exceeded  
- Recommended remediation  

---

## 6. Routine Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Tool / Script |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Security patching | Weekly | `scripts/patch_all.sh` |
| Database vacuum/analyze | Weekly | `db_maintenance.sql` |
| TLS renewal | Quarterly | `certbot renew` |
| Dependency scan | Weekly | `pip-audit` / `npm audit` |
| Container cleanup | Weekly | `docker system prune` |
| Log rotation | Daily | `logrotate.conf` |
| Backup verification | Weekly | `verify_backup.py` |

---

## 7. Backup Strategy

- **Frequency:** Incremental every hour, full every 24 hours.  
- **Storage:** Encrypted S3 bucket (`kindid-backups`) with versioning.  
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM per archive.  
- **Testing:** Quarterly restore tests using staging environment.  
- **Retention:** 90 days (auto purge after verification).  

---

## 8. Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detection:** Alert triggers from monitoring system.  
2. **Classification:** Severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).  
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers or nodes.  
4. **Investigation:** Analyze logs and audit trails.  
5. **Recovery:** Rollback to last verified state.  
6. **Postmortem:** Within 24 hours, document root cause and mitigation.  

All postmortems stored in `/docs/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

## 9. Performance Optimization

- Enable async request handling (FastAPI + Uvicorn).  
- Use connection pooling for PostgreSQL.  
- Cache ZKP computations in Redis.  
- Optimize Docker images with multi-stage builds.  
- Serve static assets via CDN.  

---

## 10. Compliance and Audit Preparation

- Retain logs per [Audit Logging Policy](../docs/AUDIT_LOGGING_POLICY.md).  
- Quarterly access review of all system accounts.  
- Verify no hardcoded secrets in repos.  
- Run automated CVE scan via Trivy + Snyk.  

---

## 11. Decommissioning Checklist

When retiring a deployment:
1. Freeze production DB.  
2. Export and encrypt all audit logs.  
3. Revoke all API and SSH keys.  
4. Destroy cloud infrastructure.  
5. File decommission report in `/docs/archives/`.
