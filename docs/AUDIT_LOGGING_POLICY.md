# KIND-ID Audit Logging Policy

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines KIND-IDâ€™s immutable audit logging framework.  
It complements:  
- [Security and Threat Model](../docs/SECURITY_AND_THREAT_MODEL.md)  
- [Governance Charter](../docs/GOVERNANCE_CHARTER.md)  
- [System Design Specification](../docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN_SPEC.md)  

The goal is to guarantee accountability, traceability, and regulatory compliance across all identity verification operations.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Immutability** | No event may be deleted or modified once recorded. |
| **Transparency** | All administrative and user actions can be externally verified. |
| **Minimal Disclosure** | Logs capture what occurred, not personal content. |
| **Chain of Custody** | Each event links cryptographically to its predecessor. |
| **Time Integrity** | All timestamps are monotonic and UTC-synced. |

---

## 3. Log Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | Coordinated Universal Time of event creation. |
| `event_id` | UUIDv4 | Unique immutable identifier. |
| `actor` | Hash | Hashed user or system identity. |
| `action` | Enum | Event type: `LOGIN`, `VERIFY`, `UPDATE`, `ADMIN_CHANGE`, etc. |
| `status` | Enum | `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `WARNING`. |
| `details` | JSON | Event metadata (non-sensitive). |
| `signature` | Base64 | Ed25519 signature of event payload. |
| `hash_prev` | Base64 | Link to previous event hash (Merkle chain). |

---

## 4. Event Categories

| Category | Example Events | Retention |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Authentication** | Login, Logout, Token refresh | 2 years |
| **Identity Proofs** | Registration, Challenge/Response | 3 years |
| **Administrative** | Policy update, Role assignment | 5 years |
| **Security** | Breach attempt, Audit override | Permanent |
| **System** | Restart, Update, Failover | 1 year |

---

## 5. Storage Model

- **Primary Log:** Append-only database (PostgreSQL `INSERT ONLY` schema).  
- **Secondary Log:** Encrypted binary flat file for redundancy.  
- **Merkle Chain Root:** Calculated daily and committed to distributed storage (e.g., IPFS).  
- **Access Layer:** Read-only API with pagination and role verification.  
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit.

---

## 6. Integrity Verification

Integrity is enforced through chained hashes:  
```

Hn = SHA3-512(Event_n || Hn-1)

```
Where `H0` is the genesis block initialized at system bootstrap.  
Periodic root snapshots are cross-verified against `AUDIT_CHAIN_ROOT` in configuration.

---

## 7. Access Control

| Role | Permissions |
|-------|--------------|
| **User** | View personal events only. |
| **Auditor** | Read full logs, export Merkle proofs. |
| **Administrator** | Limited to configuration, not event modification. |
| **System Process** | Append-only write privileges. |

---

## 8. Retention and Redaction Policy

- Personal identifiers are hashed at log time.  
- Logs older than retention threshold are cryptographically shredded (key deletion).  
- Exported logs use pseudonymous identifiers only.  
- Audit exports require dual administrative approval.

---

## 9. Regulatory Alignment

| Framework | Relevance |
|------------|------------|
| **NIST SP 800-92** | Logging and monitoring recommendations |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | Security operations and event management |
| **GDPR (Art. 30, 32, 33)** | Processing, integrity, and breach reporting |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Security, Availability, Confidentiality principles |

---

## 10. Monitoring and Review

- **Continuous Log Verification:** Background process validates hashes every 6 hours.  
- **Alert System:** Email/SMS alerts on signature mismatch.  
- **Quarterly Audits:** Random verification of historical chains.  
- **Public Proofs:** Optional transparency uploads to a public ledger.
