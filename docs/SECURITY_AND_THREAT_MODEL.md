# KIND-ID Security and Threat Model

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **security architecture** and **threat model** for KIND-ID, explaining how user authentication data, cryptographic operations, and system integrity are protected across devices and servers.  

It serves as a baseline for internal audits, pen tests, and external certification.

---

## 2. Security Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Zero Knowledge** | The server never stores user secrets or unhashed phrases. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple independent layers (client, SDK, API, database) mitigate risk. |
| **Transparency by Default** | All security mechanisms are auditable in open source. |
| **Least Privilege** | Components operate only with permissions necessary for their function. |
| **Fail-Safe Defaults** | Any system failure defaults to secure mode (deny access). |
| **Human-Centric Security** | Authentication built around memorability and clarity, not obscurity. |

---

## 3. Cryptographic Stack

| Component | Algorithm | Purpose |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Hashing | **Argon2id** | Memory-hard phrase hashing |
| Key Exchange | **Ed25519** | Public/private keypair generation |
| Encryption | **AES-256-GCM** | Secure local descriptor storage |
| Signing | **HMAC-SHA256** | Message authentication |
| Randomness | **os.urandom() / secrets** | Entropy for salts and keys |
| Integrity | **SHA3-512** | Code integrity checks |

Each cryptographic primitive follows NIST and RFC specifications with Python `cryptography` and `argon2-cffi` bindings.

---

## 4. Authentication Flow

### 1️⃣ Descriptor Generation
- Phrase + Device ID + Salt → Argon2id hash → Descriptor stored locally.

### 2️⃣ Server Registration
- Descriptor transmitted via TLS 1.3 to FastAPI server.
- Server stores only hash and salt — never plaintext.

### 3️⃣ Verification
- User phrase hashed again → compared in constant time via HMAC-SHA256.
- Server returns confidence score.

### 4️⃣ Session Token
- JWT signed with Ed25519 private key.
- Valid for 15 minutes; refreshable.

---

## 5. Data Protection

| Data | Location | Protection |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| User phrase | Local only | Never transmitted |
| Descriptor | Local + server | Argon2id + salt |
| Session token | Server-side memory | Auto-expiry after 15 mins |
| API secrets | `.env` file | Never committed |
| Logs | Sanitized | No personal data retained |

---

## 6. Network Security

- HTTPS enforced (TLS 1.3)
- HSTS headers enabled
- Rate limiting (60 req/min per IP)
- Nonce validation for all POST requests
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restricted to whitelisted origins
- Automatic 429 and 401 responses for brute-force detection

---

## 7. Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Phishing** | Phrase recognition limited to device; zero reuse across services. |
| **Keylogging** | Optional keyboard randomization extension for sensitive entry. |
| **Replay Attacks** | Nonce + timestamp validation for every transaction. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Unique Argon2 salt and device tie-in. |
| **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)** | TLS 1.3 + certificate pinning in extension. |
| **Server Compromise** | Argon2id one-way hashes, no plaintext data. |
| **Social Engineering** | Descriptors unlinkable to identity outside client. |
| **Side-Channel Attacks** | Constant-time comparison; no timing leaks. |
| **Code Injection** | CSP + integrity checks on all scripts. |

---

## 8. Security Testing

| Test Type | Tool / Framework |
|------------|------------------|
| Static Code Analysis | Bandit, PyLint |
| Dependency Scanning | pip-audit, Safety |
| Dynamic App Testing | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite |
| API Fuzzing | Schemathesis |
| Load & Rate Limit | Locust |
| Cryptographic Review | libsodium test suite |

CI/CD runs these on every push.

---

## 9. Incident Response

| Step | Action |
|------|---------|
| **1. Detection** | Monitor CI logs and server alerts |
| **2. Containment** | Disable compromised keys immediately |
| **3. Eradication** | Patch and rebuild image |
| **4. Recovery** | Deploy new version via GitHub Actions |
| **5. Lessons Learned** | Publish report and improve test coverage |

---

## 10. Compliance & Audits

KIND-ID aims to comply with:

- OWASP ASVS Level 2
- GDPR minimal data collection
- CCPA transparency clause
- SOC 2 Type II readiness
- NIST 800-63B guidelines

Formal third-party audit planned post v1.1.0.

---

## 11. Future Security Enhancements

| Version | Planned Feature |
|----------|----------------|
| 1.1.0 | Biometric fallback (optional) |
| 1.2.0 | Remote attestation (TEE) |
| 1.3.0 | Encrypted backup recovery flow |
| 2.0.0 | Hardware token support (YubiKey, Titan) |

---

## 12. Responsible Disclosure

Researchers can report vulnerabilities via:
**security@kindid.io**

Reports will be acknowledged within **72 hours**, and remediation status posted in public changelog.
