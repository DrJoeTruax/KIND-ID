# KIND-ID Risk Register

### Version 1.0.0  
### Updated: October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document identifies, categorizes, and manages potential risks affecting the security, reliability, and governance of the **KIND-ID** system.  
It supports proactive mitigation aligned with the [Security and Threat Model](../docs/SECURITY_AND_THREAT_MODEL.md) and [Change Management Policy](../docs/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md).

## 2. Risk Classification

| Level | Description | Required Action |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to system integrity or user trust. | Escalate and mitigate within 24 hours. |
| **High** | Potential to disrupt major services or expose sensitive data. | Mitigate within 72 hours. |
| **Medium** | Moderate operational or reputational impact. | Address in next release. |
| **Low** | Minor inconvenience or low likelihood event. | Monitor and log only. |

## 3. Risk Matrix

| ID | Category | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Level | Mitigation |
|----|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| R-01 | **Security** | Zero-day vulnerability in dependency | Medium | High | High | Continuous CVE scanning (`trivy`, `snyk`) and rapid patch process. |
| R-02 | **Data Integrity** | Corruption in audit log storage | Low | Critical | High | Daily hash validation and immutable backup to S3. |
| R-03 | **Compliance** | Unintentional GDPR violation via metadata | Low | High | Medium | Periodic compliance audits and anonymization checks. |
| R-04 | **Operational** | Container orchestration failure | Medium | Medium | Medium | Auto-restart policy in Kubernetes and health probes. |
| R-05 | **Human Error** | Improper environment variable exposure | High | High | Critical | Enforce `dotenv-linter` and peer review for secrets. |
| R-06 | **Performance** | API latency >200ms under load | Medium | Medium | Medium | Load testing and caching optimization. |
| R-07 | **Availability** | Database outage or backup failure | Low | Critical | High | Multi-region replication and restore drills. |
| R-08 | **Legal** | Export control non-compliance | Low | High | Medium | Annual export filing and restricted distribution tracking. |
| R-09 | **Reputation** | Misuse of KIND-ID by unethical actors | Medium | High | High | Enforce ethical-use policy and license revocation. |
| R-10 | **Dependency Drift** | Unpinned or outdated packages | High | Medium | Medium | Use lockfiles and Dependabot automation. |

## 4. Monitoring and Review

- **Frequency:** Monthly risk review meeting.  
- **Ownership:** Maintained by the Governance Board.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Reassess likelihood and impact.  
  2. Update mitigation strategies.  
  3. Archive closed risks under `/docs/risks/archive/`.  
  4. Create incident postmortems for realized events.  

---

## 5. Early Warning Indicators

| Category | Signal | Response |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Security | Spike in failed authentication attempts | Initiate log review and IP blocking. |
| Infrastructure | Increase in container restarts | Inspect pod health and autoscaling logs. |
| Compliance | Data subject request backlog | Escalate to privacy officer. |
| Performance | Elevated CPU or memory trends | Trigger scale-up via HPA. |

## 6. Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Preventive Controls:** Code scanning, static analysis, dependency audits.  
2. **Detective Controls:** Monitoring alerts, anomaly detection, penetration testing.  
3. **Corrective Controls:** Rollback, failover, incident response protocols.  
4. **Compensating Controls:** Legal agreements, insurance, redundancy.  

---

## 7. Risk Acceptance and Escalation

- Minor and medium risks may be accepted by maintainers.  
- High and critical risks require Governance Board approval.  
- Acceptance must be documented with rationale and timeline for re-evaluation.  

---

## 8. Recordkeeping

All risk decisions and changes logged in:
```

/docs/risks/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md

```
Each entry includes risk ID, owner, decision, and next review date.

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement

Risk maturity is tracked via:
- Average closure time  
- Number of repeated incidents  
- Ratio of mitigated vs. residual risks  

Quarterly summaries feed into governance reports.
