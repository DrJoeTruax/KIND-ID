  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
````

* Install dependencies:

  ```bash

## Branching Model

We use a simplified **GitHub Flow**:

| Branch           | Purpose                           |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `main`           | Stable, production-ready releases |
| `dev`            | Active development                |
| `feature/<name>` | Specific feature work             |
| `fix/<name>`     | Bug fixes                         |
| `docs/<topic>`   | Documentation updates             |

Merge only through pull requests. Each PR requires:

* Passing CI tests
* Reviewer approval
* Signed commits

## Commit Conventions

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format:

```

## Testing & Linting

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -v
```

Run linter and type checker:

```bash
flake8 kindid
mypy kindid
```

JavaScript linting for the extension:

```bash
npm run lint --prefix extension
```

All tests must pass before merging.

## Documentation Standards

* Every public function/class must have a docstring following Google style.
* Markdown files should start with a level-1 heading and end with a horizontal rule.
* All docs live in `/docs` and are cross-linked from the root [README](README.md).
